Readme - Basic CRT shader for processing

This is based off ot the CRT Styled Scan-line Shader by Timoth Lottes. 
I have disabled the function for the warping for my purposes.

if you want to use it just read the comments in the crt.glsl file.

this includes a vertical sync band shader as well, based on MattiasCRT: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms23DR
